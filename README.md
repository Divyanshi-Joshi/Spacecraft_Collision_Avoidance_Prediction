# Spacecraft Collision Prediction



## About this project

This project was undertaken as part of my Internship at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

## Why this project

Historically, spacecraft collision prediction has relied on manual tracking and basic statistical methods to identify potential collision risks. The advent of more sophisticated space surveillance networks and the proliferation of space objects necessitated more advanced techniques. Traditional methods involved simple probability calculations based on object trajectories, but as the number of orbiting objects increased, the need for more accurate and automated prediction methods became evident.


## About this project

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to improve the prediction accuracy of potential spacecraft collisions. By analyzing historical conjunction data messages (CDMs), these models can capture complex patterns and temporal dependencies that traditional methods may miss. The study outlines the process of data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of RNN and CNN models.
